# Homework 1!

## Set up

Make sure to `poetry install` to install the dependencies!
Also, make sure to run `poetry shell` to activate the virtual environment.

## Formatting

To run the formatters, run `black . && isort . && flake8` in the root directory.

If you commit, the github workflow will fail if the code is not formatted correctly.
